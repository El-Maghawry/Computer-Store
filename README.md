For this assignment a dynamic webpage using “vanilla” JavaScript had to be build abiding certain guidelines.
Any visiuals were an extra for this assignment the focus was on the functionality.

- By clicking on _Work and Earn_ you can enter the amounts of hours worked.
- By clicking on _Transfer to Bank_ you can transfer the money you have earned to the Bank.
  - if you have debt 10% will go to paying off your loan/debt.
- _Pay Loan_  appears when you have a running loan or debt. you will pay using Amount Earned.
- To get a Loan you can press the _Get a loan_ button.
  - You cannot get a loan that is double you bank balance.
  - You can only have one loan at once until it has been paid off in full.
- A small extra feature that I have added is the purchased section. Purchases will appear in this section.

## View Project
- The fastest way to view the project is through the Heroku link:
https://computer-store-web-application.herokuapp.com
- The app should also work in your browser (Chrome preferred) should you decide to pull it and run it from your IDE.
